# Place Your Resume Here

Add your PDF resume to this location with the filename `resume.pdf`.

Alternatively, you can:
1. Update the `resumeUrl` in `src/constants/data.ts` to point to your resume hosted elsewhere
2. Link to your LinkedIn profile or online resume

## Example:
```
public/
  └── resume.pdf  <- Your resume file
```
